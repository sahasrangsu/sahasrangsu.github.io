        			<p><b>Manipal Institute of Technology, <a href="http://manipal.edu/mu.html">Manipal University</a></b></p>
				<p><i><u>“Preparation and characterization of ceramic membrane and its use.”</u></i></p>
        			<p><li>The project was based on the preparation of kaolin clay based micro-filtration membrane and the characterization of the same. The main focus of the project was to create low-cost membranes. So before beginning the project the raw materials, including suitable additives and preparation techniques were decided after doing intensive literature review such that the raw materials would be easily attainable as
well as low costing, also the preparation technique would be cost effective and simple to perform. Knowledge about different characterization techniques was gathered to understand more about the membrane morphology along with its various physical and chemical characteristics. After this, the moulds were crafted using various mechanical equipment in a workshop and then the membranes with different compositions were fabricated using the paste casting technique. The fabricated membranes of various compositions were then characterized using various characterization techniques such as a BET surface area analyzer, TGA (Thermogravimetric Analysis), Mercury Porosimetry test, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy), powder XRD (X-ray Diffraction) and EDAX (Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) . Permeation studies were conducted with in-house built apparatus. The characterization techniques revealed satisfactory morphology, pore structure and also indicated stability of the membrane. Encouraging results were found in respect of water permeation.

        			<p><li>Studied the coke-making facilities, characteristics of procured coal, preparation of charge coal, charge coal characteristics, coke characteristics which included important properties of coke and their desired properties and finally co-relating the coke
properties with charge coal characteristics. Coke supplies the thermal energy and the reductants for iron production. This iron grade coke is manufactured in the coke oven batteries. About 5 million tons of coal from various sources, both indigenous and imported is procured each year. Coals of different categories are blended and processed for preparation, coal charge which is charged into the ovens wherein high-temperature carbonization occurs to produce coke of required quality. However, deviations from target values were found to exist. Attempts were made during this training program to study several aspects of coke making practice adopted at the coke oven shop of the plant. Since coking temperature and duration are kept uniform, charge coal characteristics were studied and correlated to the properties of produced coke. Significant relationships were found to exist among several variables which could be useful in coal and coke management.</li></p>
